# PillCare – Medicine Guardians

## Motivation / Problem
Many people, especially elderly ones, and chronic patients forget to take their medicines on time.
This can cause health problems and stress for both the patient and their family.
Our app helps them remember, track, and feel supported with a friendly and fun experience.

## Target Users
- Elderly people and chronic patients who need help managing daily medicines.
- Family members who want to follow up and encourage their loved ones.

## Core Features 

- [ ] Choose user role: patient or family helper.
- [x] Simple signup with name, email, password, and birth date (optimized for seniors with large, easy date picker).
- [ ] Add a medicine with schedule (time, dosage, type).
- [ ] Edit or delete existing medicines.
- [ ] View list of all medicines.
- [ ] View today's medicines ordered by time.
- [ ] Mark medicine as taken and show when a medicine is late.

## Complementary Features (later in Sprint 2 + Nice to Have)

## Technologies We Plan to Use
- Flutter (mobile app)
- Firebase Authentication (user login)
- Cloud Firestore (store medicines, schedules, history, points)
- Local notifications (reminders on device)

## Risks and Challenges
- Designing clear and simple screens for elderly users.
- Implementing reliable local notifications on Android.
- Time management: implementing both core features and gamification within the semester.
